# Getting Involved

New contributors are always welcome, and when in doubt please ask questions! We strive to be an open and welcoming community. Please be nice to one another.

We recommend heading over to fog's [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/fog/fog/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and having a look around as well.  It has information and context about the state of the `fog` project as a whole.

## Contributing Code

This document is very much a work in progress.  Sorry about that.

It's worth noting that, if you're looking through the code, and you'd like to know the history of a line, you may not find it in the history of this repository, since most of the code was extracted from [fog/fog](https://github.com/fog/fog).  So, you can look at the history from commit [fog/fog#c596e](https://github.com/fog/fog/tree/c596e710952aa9c90713da3fbfb3027db0608413) backward for more information.

### Development environment

If you're going to be doing any kind of modifications, I highly recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build), (don't forget the [dependencies](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/wiki#suggested-build-environment)!) and [bundler](http://bundler.io/).

Once you've got that all installed, run

```shell
$ bundle install
```

to install the required gems.  You might have to [fight a bit](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html) to get Nokogiri installed.

Then, you should be ready to go!  If you'd like to drop into an interactive shell, configured with your `:test` credential, use

```shell
rake console
```

### Testing

This module is tested with [Minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest).  Right now, the only tests that exist are live integration tests, found in `test/integration/`.  After completing the installation in the README, (including setting up your credentials and keys,) make sure you have a `:test` credential in `~/.fog`, something like:

```
test:
  google_project: my-project
  google_client_email: xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx@developer.gserviceaccount.com
  google_json_key_location: /path/to/my-project-xxxxxxxxxxxxx.json
```

Then you can run all the live tests:

```shell
$ rake test
```

or just one API:

```
$ rake test:compute
```
(See `rake -T` for all available tasks)

or just one file:

```shell
$ rake test TEST=test/integration/compute/test_servers.rb TESTOPTS="--name=TestServers#test_bootstrap_ssh_destroy"
```

#### The transition from `shindo` to Minitest

Previously, [shindo](https://github.com/geemus/shindo) was the primary testing framework.  We've started moving away from it, and to Minitest, but some artifacts may remain.

For more information on transition, read [#50](https://github.com/fog/fog-google/issues/50).

#### Continuous integration

Currently Google maintains a [Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/) server, running a pipeline defined in `ci` folder. 
It automatically runs all integration tests against every pull-request marked with `integration` label.

For more information on the pipeline please refer to the [ci README](https://github.com/fog/fog-google/blob/master/ci/README.md).

#### Some notes about the tests as they stand

The live integration tests for resources, (servers, disks, etc.,) have a few components:

- The `TestCollection` **mixin module** lives in `test/helpers/test_collection.rb` and contains the standard tests to run for all resources, (e.g. `test_lifecycle`).  It also calls `cleanup` on the resource's factory during teardown, to make sure that resources are getting destroyed before the next test run.
- The **factory**, (e.g. `ServersFactory`, in `test/integration/factories/servers_factory.rb`,) automates the creation of resources and/or supplies parameters for explicit creation of resources.  For example, `ServersFactory` initializes a `DisksFactory` to supply disks in order to create servers, and implements the `params` method so that tests can create servers with unique names, correct zones and machine types, and automatically-created disks.  `ServersFactory` inherits the `create` method from `CollectionFactory`, which allows tests to create servers on-demand.
- The **main test**, (e.g. `TestServers`, in `test/integration/compute/test_servers.rb`,) is the test that actually runs.  It mixes in the `TestCollection` module in order to run the tests in that module, it supplies the `setup` method in which it initializes a `ServersFactory`, and it includes any other tests specific to this collection, (e.g. `test_bootstrap_ssh_destroy`).

If you want to create another resource, you should add live integration tests; all you need to do is create a factory in `test/integration/factories/my_resource_factory.rb` and a main test in `test/integration/compute/test_my_resource.rb` that mixes in `TestCollection`.
